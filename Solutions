RIVER WATER QUALITY PARAMETERS
Monitoring river water quality by understanding the principal water indicators and their parameters is crucial to control pollution.
Key river water quality control parameters are pH, biological oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids (SS), dissolved oxygen (DO), and total coliform bacteria.
• Dissolved Oxygen (DO) - The quantity of dissolved oxygen is a key indicator of water quality in rivers. Factors affecting levels of dissolved oxygen include sources such as number of bacteria as well as the water temperature.
• Turbidity and Total Suspended Solids (TSS) - The measurement of turbidity levels depends upon the concentration of Total Suspended Solids (TSS). Lighter solids will settle at the bottom of a body of water; if there are a lot of solids present, the surface water becomes cloudy or less clear.
• pH - Factors causing river water pH change include acid rain, automobile pollution, agricultural runoff, spills due to accidents, overflows from sewers and other pollutants. Major changes to pH scales can have damaging impacts on water, fish, and aquatic life, so it is another key water quality indicator.
• Bio indicators - Living organisms such as plants, planktons, animals and microbes (coliform bacteria) – provides valuable information for assessing the quality of water as well an important indicator of water pollution.
• Temperature - The water temperature will also affect other parameters of water quality, such as the dissolved oxygen and vulnerability of organisms to parasites, pollution, and disease.
• We can conclude that it needs proper maintaining and they must treat the water before discharging into the ground.
SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVE RIVER WATER QUALITY:
i. Limit the use of chemicals and use organic or organic fertilizers and pesticides. Plant more trees. If you live by the coast, clean up beaches or remove plastic from rivers near your home. Finally, the issue of water pollution should always be in the back of your mind in your daily activities
ii. River water treatment is the process of removing contaminants from flowing or standing river water by combining traditional and advanced treatment processes such as coagulation, flocculation, clarification, sedimentation, filtration and water disinfection to create environmentally safe and clean water suitable for drinking and multipurpose domestic use, institutional and industrial applications.
iii. Remove or neutralize any limiting factors, such as point source discharges or agricultural runoff, that impede the natural regeneration of the area in the short and long term.
iv. More efficient management of stocks, for example, fencing of streams and waterways to prevent direct water pollution.
v. Be careful when using fertilizers and insecticides.
vi. Careful planning of town and subdivision developments to ensure they have the least possible impact on nearby waterways
vii. Strengthening supervision of septic tanks in residential areas.
CONCLUSION:
▪ Pollution is a deterioration of water quality caused by human agencies that makes the water less suitable for use than it was originally. Water does not have to be completely pure to be considered unpolluted. Palar River is mostly polluted by Tanneries, Textile, and other industries sewage from nearby towns and villages, and some agricultural practices.
▪ Pollution can come from many different sources, including domestic sewage, farms, industry, and mining, quarrying and cooling. There are many types of pollutants, including natural organic materials, living organisms, plant nutrients, organic and inorganic chemicals, sediments and heat.
▪ To improve the quality of the Palar River and ground water sewage treatment and special treatments for heavy metals discharge from several industries is required highly like inRanitec Waste water treatment plant and new technologies can be implemented.
▪ Sewage treatment which aims to reduce the amount of organic and suspended solid material present, remove toxic materials and eliminate pathogenic bacteria, mainly by settlement or biological processes. The effluent is discharged into rivers, lakes or the sea, and the remaining sludge may be dumped at sea disposed of on farmland, dumped in landfills or incinerated.
